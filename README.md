This project demonstrates how to use basic HTML elements and attributes learned from The-Odin-Project. The project contains three recipes that have descriptions, ingredients, and steps on how to cook the dish. Files should be set in their proper folders and sub-folders. Each recipe has an image to showcase what the dish looks like. Each recipe can be navigated through the index file.
